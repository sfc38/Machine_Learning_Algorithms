This report presents the derivation of the closed form solution for linear regression, which provides an explicit expression for the optimal coefficient vector.\n","\n","## Cost Function Formulation\n","The cost function in linear regression is typically expressed as the Sum of Squared Errors (SSE), defined as the sum of the squared differences between the actual values ($Y_i$) and the predicted values ($\\hat{Y_i}$) for each data point. Mathematically, it can be represented as:\n","\n","$$J = \\sum_{1}^{N}{(Y_i - \\hat{Y_i})^2}$$\n","Where $N$ is the number of data points, $Y_i$ is the actual value for data point $i$, and $\\hat{Y_i}$ is the predicted value for data point $i$.\n","\n","## Derivation of the Closed Form Solution\n","\n","To minimize the cost function J, we take the derivative with respect to the coefficient vector $\\theta$, set it equal to zero, and solve for $\\theta$. Let's proceed with the derivation.\n","\n","The cost function can be expressed in matrix form as:\n","$$J = (Y - X\\theta)^T (Y - X\\theta)$$\n","\n","(Since we know that when A is a matrix, the following relationship holds true:\n","$||A||^2 = A^T A$)\n","\n","Utilizing the transpose property $(A+B)^T = A^T + B^T$, we can rearrange the terms:\n","\n","$$J = (Y^T - (X\\theta)^T) (Y - X\\theta)$$\n","\n","Furthermore, utilizing the transpose property $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$, we simplify the expression:\n","\n","$$J = (Y^T - \\theta^TX^T) (Y - X\\theta)$$\n"," \n","Expanding the equation:\n","$$J = Y^T Y - Y^T (X\\theta) - (\\theta^T X^T) Y + (\\theta^T X^T) (X\\theta)$$\n","\n","Simplifying further:\n","$$J = Y^T Y - Y^T X \\theta - \\theta^T X^T Y + X^T X \\theta^2$$\n","\n","To minimize J, we take the derivative with respect to $\\theta$:\n","$$ \\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{\\theta}} = 0$$\n","\n","Let's go term by term:\n","\n","$$\\frac{\\partial{(Y^T Y)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} = 0$$\n","$$\\frac{\\partial{(Y^T X \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} = (Y^TX)^T$$\n","Here, we used the fact that $\\frac{\\partial{(A X)}}{\\partial{X}} = A^T$\n","\n","\n","$$\\frac{\\partial{(\\theta^T X^T Y)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} = X^T Y$$\n","Here, we used the fact that $\\frac{\\partial{(X^T A)}}{\\partial{X}} = A$\n","\n","\n","$$\\frac{\\partial{(\\theta^T X^T X \\theta)}}{\\partial{\\theta}} = 2 X^T X \\theta$$\n","\n","Finally:\n","\n","$$ \\frac{\\partial{J}}{\\partial{\\theta}} \n","=-(Y^TX)^T - X^T Y + 2 X^T X \\theta\n","= 0$$\n","\n","\n","We know that $(A^T)^T = A$ and $(AB)^T = B^T A^T$.

By minimizing the cost function using the derivative and setting it equal to zero, we derive the closed form expression. This solution allows for a direct calculation of the optimal coefficients, simplifying the process of fitting a linear regression model to the given data."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"P5zxGvk0jGQc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"authorship_tag":"ABX9TyPnY22LxSvRuc4J4+QeQF1p"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.13"},"varInspector":{"cols":{"lenName":16,"lenType":16,"lenVar":40},"kernels_config":{"python":{"delete_cmd_postfix":"","delete_cmd_prefix":"del ","library":"var_list.py","varRefreshCmd":"print(var_dic_list())"},"r":{"delete_cmd_postfix":") ","delete_cmd_prefix":"rm(","library":"var_list.r","varRefreshCmd":"cat(var_dic_list()) "}},"types_to_exclude":["module","function","builtin_function_or_method","instance","_Feature"],"window_display":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
